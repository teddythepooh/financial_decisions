## Financial Decision Making

I am creating a set of financial tools to help me organize my finances. My three goals are to:
* track changes in federal income tax liability based on my income and future contributions to tax-deferred accounts;
* estimate my expected returns on securities if and when I start building an investment portfolio;
* and create an expenses dashboard to examine my current (and future) spending habits.
